# Economic Impact of Declining Fertility Rates in Armenia


## Project Overview

This study investigates the long-term economic consequences of Armenia's falling fertility rate, assessing whether demographic decline leads to weaker GDP growth. Using historical data and statistical modeling, we evaluate the relationship between fertility rates, labor force dynamics, and economic output.

## Key Hypotheses

1. **Hypothesis 1**: A decline in Armenia's fertility rate reduces long-term GDP growth due to a shrinking working-age population.
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Fertility rate categories are statistically associated with labor force size categories in Armenia.

## Research Methodology

### Data Sources
- World Bank Development Indicators

### Statistical Techniques
- Regression modeling
